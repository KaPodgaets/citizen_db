## Description
This task involved creating the developer-focused documentation for the Citizen Data Pipeline. This guide serves as a single source of truth for developers on how to set up, build, test, and contribute code.

## Acceptance Criteria
- An architecture document (`ARCH-dev-standards-v1.md`) has been created.
- The document details the development environment setup, including `requirements-dev.txt`.
- It defines coding standards (e.g., `ruff`, `black`) and testing procedures, providing example commands.
- It specifies the Git branching strategy and the complete Pull Request process, including review expectations.

## Definition of Done
- The `ARCH-dev-standards-v1.md` document is created and populated with all content specified in Phase 2 of the design plan.
- A new developer can set up their environment and submit a compliant PR using only this document as a guide.

## Notes
This task corresponds to the creation of the `CONTRIBUTING.md` content as described in the original design plan.
