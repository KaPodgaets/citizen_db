## Description
This task covered the finalization and integration of the newly created documentation artifacts. It involved ensuring the documents were cohesive and easy to navigate between.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Cross-links have been added between the user-facing (`ARCH-pipeline-overview`) and developer-facing (`ARCH-dev-standards`) documents.
- The user guide now contains a note pointing developers to the contribution guide.
- The contribution guide links back to the user guide for a high-level project overview.
- Both documents have been reviewed for accuracy, clarity, and completeness.

## Definition of Done
- All relevant cross-links are in place.
- A final proofread of both documents has been completed.
- All critical concepts from the original specification are confirmed to be present in the new documentation structure.

## Notes
This task corresponds to Phase 3 of the original design plan.
