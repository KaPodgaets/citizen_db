## Description
This task covers the strategic overhaul of the project's documentation. The previous technical specification (`autogen_readme.md`) was refactored into two distinct, audience-focused architectural documents: a user-centric guide and a developer-centric contribution guide. The goal was to improve onboarding for both new users running the pipeline and new developers contributing to it.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A clear, step-by-step guide for a junior data engineer to set up, configure, and run the pipeline has been created (`ARCH-pipeline-overview`).
- A comprehensive guide for developers outlining coding standards, testing procedures, and the contribution workflow has been created (`ARCH-dev-standards`).
- Concerns are separated: documentation for *using* the project is distinct from documentation for *developing* the project.

## Definition of Done
- All relevant technical details from the original specification have been migrated to the new architecture documents.
- The new documents accurately reflect the current state of the codebase and its intended use.
- Child tasks for each phase of the plan are completed.

## Notes
This epic task represents the implementation of the "Design Plan: Documentation Overhaul for User & Developer Onboarding".
