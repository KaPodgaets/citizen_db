## Description
This task involved creating the user-focused documentation for the Citizen Data Pipeline. The content, previously part of a dense technical spec, was reshaped into a standalone guide aimed at a junior data engineer.

## Acceptance Criteria
- An architecture document (`ARCH-pipeline-overview-v1.md`) has been created.
- The document includes a project introduction, key features, and a high-level architecture diagram (Mermaid).
- A "Getting Started" section provides explicit, copy-paste-friendly instructions for environment setup and configuration.
- A "Running the Pipeline" section clearly documents the operational workflow, including script commands and file naming conventions.

## Definition of Done
- The `ARCH-pipeline-overview-v1.md` document is created and populated with all content specified in Phase 1 of the design plan.
- A junior data engineer can successfully run the pipeline using only this document as a guide.

## Notes
This task corresponds to the creation of the `README.md` content as described in the original design plan.
