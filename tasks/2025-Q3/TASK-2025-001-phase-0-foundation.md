## Description
This parent task covers all foundational work required to establish a stable, reproducible development environment and the core utilities for the data pipeline. This includes project structure, dependency management, core utilities for DB access and logging, and the DDL/contract definitions for all data layers.

## Acceptance Criteria
All child tasks are completed. The project has a working, configurable foundation for logging, database interaction, and dependency management. The complete five-layer database schema (`meta`, `raw`, `stage`, `core`, `mart`) is defined in DDLs. Versioned, structurally-validated YAML contracts for column mapping are in place.
