## Description
Create a centralized utility module, `src/utils/parsing.py`, to handle complex, reusable parsing logic, specifically for handling various date formats from Excel and for loading/validating the versioned YAML contracts.

## Acceptance Criteria
The `src/utils/parsing.py` module is created and contains functions to correctly parse dates and load the appropriate version of a YAML contract, including structural validation with Pydantic.
