## Description
This epic covers the comprehensive refactoring of the data ingestion and staging pipeline to incorporate robust upfront validation and implement a sophisticated, multi-tier staging architecture. A key refinement is the implementation of a period-aware loading strategy for the database stage layer.

## Acceptance Criteria
All child tasks are completed. The pipeline successfully ingests source files, creates validated Parquet files, and loads them into the stage database using transactional, period-aware logic. The transform step correctly processes data by period. The implementation is covered by tests.
Note: The implementation of the load_stage.py script itself is tracked under TASK-2025-025.
