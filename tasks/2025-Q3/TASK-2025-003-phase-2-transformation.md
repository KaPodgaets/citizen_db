## Description
This parent task covers the implementation of the core business logic. This includes creating the historized `core` layer with SCD-2 logic, populating the analytics-ready `mart` layer, and building the orchestrator to tie the steps together.

## Acceptance Criteria
All child tasks are completed. The `run_pipeline.py` script can be executed to process a new validated file through the `transform` and `publish` steps, resulting in updated `core` and `mart` tables.
