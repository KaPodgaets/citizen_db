## Description
Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for the new and refactored pipeline components, with a special focus on the transactional loading logic.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Unit tests for new utility functions are created.
- Integration tests for ingest.py and validate.py are implemented.
- Specific integration tests for load_stage.py are created to verify:

A first-time load for a period works correctly.

Re-loading for the same period correctly replaces old data without affecting other periods.

A failed load correctly rolls back the transaction, leaving the old data intact.
