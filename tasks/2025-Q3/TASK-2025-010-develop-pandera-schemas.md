## Description
Define the data quality rules and expected structure for incoming source data using the Pandera library. This creates the data contracts for the pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria
Pandera schema files are created in the `schemas/` directory for the initial set of data sources (e.g., citizens). The schemas define columns, data types, and validation rules.
