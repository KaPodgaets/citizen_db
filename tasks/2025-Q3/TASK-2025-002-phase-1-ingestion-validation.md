## Description
This parent task covers the development of the first part of the ELT pipeline: reliably ingesting source files, validating them against multiple contract layers, and moving them through the `raw` and `stage` database schemas.

## Acceptance Criteria
All child tasks are completed. The pipeline can successfully ingest a new source file, validate its name, map its columns using versioned contracts, load it to the `raw` schema, validate its content with Pandera, and load the clean result into the `stage` schema, logging all actions to the `meta` tables.
