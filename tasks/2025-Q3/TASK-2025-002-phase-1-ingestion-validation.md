## Description
This parent task covers the development of the first part of the ELT pipeline: reliably landing source files, registering them, and validating them against defined data contracts to ensure quality.

## Acceptance Criteria
All child tasks are completed. The pipeline can successfully ingest a new source file, validate it, and produce a clean Parquet file in the staging area, logging all actions to the `meta` tables.
