## Description
Ensure that all pipeline failures are caught, centrally logged, and made visible to operators for quick remediation.

## Acceptance Criteria
All main scripts (`ingest.py`, `validate.py`, etc.) use a decorator or context manager that wraps their main logic in a `try...except` block. All exceptions are caught and logged to both the console and the `meta.etl_audit` table with a 'FAIL' status and detailed error message.
