## Description
Implement the `validate.py` script to check a landed file against its Pandera schema and produce a clean Parquet file for the next stage.

## Acceptance Criteria
The script takes a `file_id` as input, loads the corresponding file, validates the data against its schema, writes a Parquet file to `data/stage/clean/` on success, and logs the result (pass or fail) to `meta.validation_log`.
