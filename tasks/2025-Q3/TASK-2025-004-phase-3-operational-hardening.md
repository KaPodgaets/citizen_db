## Description
This parent task covers work to make the pipeline robust, easy to operate, and failure-resistant. This includes implementing comprehensive error handling and providing a safe rollback procedure.

## Acceptance Criteria
All child tasks are completed. Pipeline failures are gracefully caught and logged to the audit table, and a faulty data load can be safely reverted using the specified rollback mechanism.
