## Description
This epic covers a strategic refactoring of the data pipeline's transformation step. The goals are to improve developer experience with better console feedback, increase modularity by moving to dataset-specific transform scripts, and simplify the core data loading logic by replacing SCD-2 with a metadata-driven "rebuild from zero" strategy.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All child tasks are completed.
- The pipeline's transformation step is modular, configuration-driven, and uses a versioned, idempotent data loading pattern.
- The developer experience is improved with clear console feedback on errors and pipeline status.
