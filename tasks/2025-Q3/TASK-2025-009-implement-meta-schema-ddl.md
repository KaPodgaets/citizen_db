## Description
Create the foundational database tables required for pipeline auditing, control, and metadata management.

## Acceptance Criteria
An idempotent DDL script is created at `sql/ddl/meta_schema.sql` that defines all tables for the `meta` schema: `etl_audit`, `ingestion_log`, `validation_log`, and `dataset_version`. The script can be executed successfully against the target MS SQL database.
