## Description
Isolate business logic for data cleansing into separate, testable modules to improve code quality and maintainability.

## Acceptance Criteria
Cleansing functions are created in the `src/transformations/` directory as pure, testable Python functions. For example, `clean_phone_number(series) -> series`.
