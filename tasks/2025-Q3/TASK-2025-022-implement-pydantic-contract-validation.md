## Description
Implement a structural validation layer for the YAML contract files to prevent runtime errors caused by typos or malformed contract definitions.

## Acceptance Criteria
A new `src/models/contracts.py` file is created containing Pydantic models that accurately define and enforce the structure of the YAML contract files.
