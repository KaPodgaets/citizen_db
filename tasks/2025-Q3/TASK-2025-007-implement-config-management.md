## Description
Implement a secure and flexible configuration management system to handle secrets and environment-specific settings (dev, test, prod).

## Acceptance Criteria
A `src/utils/config.py` module is created that uses `pydantic-settings` to load settings from a `.env` file. A `.env.example` file is committed to the repository, while the actual `.env` file is included in `.gitignore`.
