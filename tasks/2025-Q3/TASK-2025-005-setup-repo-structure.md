## Description
Create the baseline project folder structure inside a new Git repository. This includes creating directories like `src/`, `src/utils`, `src/transformations`, `schemas/`, `sql/`, and a comprehensive `.gitignore` file.

## Acceptance Criteria
A Git repository is created with the documented folder tree and a suitable `.gitignore` file.
